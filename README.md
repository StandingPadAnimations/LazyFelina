# LazyFelina
LazyFelina is in the beta phase, but is avalible for anyone to use. I create parts of it with the help of Darfall's scripting tutorials.
Special Thanks to Breadcrumb and Therawfish for helping me when I had a issue with the sunbeams node.
Place for the LazyFelina Addon. Here, you can report bugs and suggest new features. Currently, it has a quick panel for Cycles and EEVEE, Text Tool panel for better text workflow, and a mist shortcut for compositing 
To install, install the .py script. To update, remove the addon and reinstall
